This scenario, outlined in his treatise [*An Essay on the Principle of Population*](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/malthus-an-essay-on-the-principle-of-population-vol-1-1826-6th-ed), is today known as a [Malthusian catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism#:~:text=This%20event%2C%20called%20a%20Malthusian,resulting%20in%20poverty%20and%20depopulation.).\n",
