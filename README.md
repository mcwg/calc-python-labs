# Preface
---

This collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks are intended as a set of labs to accompany a calculus course.


## A Virtual Lab for Experimenting with Calculus
---

These materials are intended as set of labs to experiment and explore concepts from calculus. Each interactive Jupyter notebooks is a "virtual laboratory" where we perform our experiments and summarize the results. 

These labs use Python as an additional tool for integrating data science into calculus and further exploring calculus. The main goal of experimental mathematics is to make mathematics **more tangible, lively and fun.** The objectives of implementing the Python labs into a calculus course are to:

- Discover patterns and relationships.
- Use graphical displays to investigate mathematical concepts.
- Develop and test conjectures.
- Explore results to help construct proofs.
- Confirm analytically derived results.
- Gain further insight and intuition.
- **Bridge the divide between theory and practice.**


## How to Access, Edit and Save Notebooks
---

In addition to the each individual Jupyter notebook in this repo, there is a html version of the materials available at , <https://github.com/mcwg/calc-python-labs/>. You cannot edit the text or run code in the html version, but there is a link to each Jupyter notebook at the start of each section.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/mcwg/calc-python-labs/blob/main/Lab1-Getting-Started-with-Colab-Python.ipynb)<nbsp>

- At the top of each notebook is a "button" such as the one above.
- Click the button to open an interactive Jupyter notebook version in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (or Colab).
- You can begin working with the notebook right away in Colab! There is no software to install (or purchase!).
- You can also access the materials directly on GitHub at <https://github.com/mcwg/calc-python-labs.git/>.


Each Jupyter notebook contains both narrative text (in Markdown cells) and Python code cells that you can create, modify, and run. Although you do not need a Google account to interact with the notebooks, the Colab notebooks are "shared", meaning you cannot save any changes to the initial shared document that opens. **If you would like to save your changes, you first need to save a copy to your Google Drive.** Then you can edit and save changes to your own version.


## What Programming Background is Required?

---


No prior experience or knowledge of Python, Markdown, or Colaboratory is assumed or required to begin working with these materials. After working with these materials, you will have some knowledge and experience with Python, Markdown, and Colaboratory!

- [Welcome to Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) is a helpful notebook (with videos) to help introduce you to Colab.
- Here's a helpful [Markdown guide](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb)


### What is Python?

---

We will be using [Python](https://www.python.org/) as a tool for experimenting with calculus concepts. Python is a widely used programming language suited for many purposes and applications such as computational mathematics, data science, and app development. We will create, modify, and run Python code in Jupyter notebooks. **No prior programming experience is required to begin working in Python in these materials.**

The goal of these materials are to investigate concepts from calculus, not learn how to be an expert Python coder. The hope is that we can use Python as a tool for experimenting and gaining insight into calculus, and in the process, gain a familiarity with Python and coding so it is no longer a barrier.
